MidiBud version of MidiPal firmware: adds support for five push buttons

Changes are:

* Pressing a button selects one of the first five parameters of the current app
* In User Program pressing a button selects one of the four user programs
* In SH-01 sequencer recording mode pressing button 1 inserts a rest, button 2 inserts a tie, 
  button 3 stops recording and button 5 stops recording and starts playback.
* No Controller app (MidiBud does not have analogue inputs)
